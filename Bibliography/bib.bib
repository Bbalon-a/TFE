abstract="The power consumption and electromagnetic radiation are among 
the most extensively used side-channels for analyzing physically 
observable cryptographic devices. This paper tackles three important 
questions in this respect. First, we compare the effectiveness of these 
two side-channels. We investigate the common belief that electromagnetic 
leakages lead to more powerful attacks than their power consumption 
counterpart. Second we study the best combination of the power and 
electromagnetic leakages. A quantified analysis based on sound information 
theoretic and security metrics is provided for these purposes. Third, we 
evaluate the effectiveness of two data dimensionality reduction techniques 
for constructing subspace-based template attacks. Selecting automatically 
the meaningful time samples in side-channel leakage traces is an important 
problem in the application of template attacks and it usually relies on 
heuristics. We show how classical statistical tools such as Principal 
Component Analysis and Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis can be used for 
efficiently preprocessing the leakage traces.",

abstract="The fair evaluation and comparison of side-channel attacks and 
countermeasures has been a long standing open question, limiting further 
developments in the field. Motivated by this challenge, this work makes a 
step in this direction and proposes a framework for the analysis of 
cryptographic implementations that includes a theoretical model and an 
application methodology. The model is based on commonly accepted 
hypotheses about side-channels that computations give rise to. It allows 
quantifying the effect of practically relevant leakage functions with a 
combination of information theoretic and security metrics, measuring the 
quality of an implementation and the strength of an adversary, 
respectively. From a theoretical point of view, we demonstrate formal 
connections between these metrics and discuss their intuitive meaning. 
From a practical point of view, the model implies a unified methodology 
for the analysis of side-channel key recovery attacks. The proposed 
solution allows getting rid of most of the subjective parameters that were 
limiting previous specialized and often ad hoc approaches in the 
evaluation of physically observable devices. It typically determines the 
extent to which basic (but practically essential) questions such as ``How 
to compare two implementations?'' or ``How to compare two side-channel 
adversaries?'' can be answered in a sound fashion.",

abstract="We propose a generic information-theoretic distinguisher for 
differential side-channel analysis. Our model of side-channel leakage is a 
refinement of the one given by Standaert et al. An embedded device 
containing a secret key is modeled as a black box with a leakage function 
whose output is captured by an adversary through the noisy measurement of 
a physical observable. Although quite general, the model and the 
distinguisher are practical and allow us to develop a new differential 
side-channel attack. More precisely, we build a distinguisher that uses 
the value of the Mutual Information between the observed measurements and 
a hypothetical leakage to rank key guesses. The attack is effective 
without any knowledge about the particular dependencies between 
measurements and leakage as well as between leakage and processed data, 
which makes it a universal tool. Our approach is confirmed by results of 
power analysis experiments. We demonstrate that the model and the attack 
work effectively in an attack scenario against DPA-resistant logic.",

abstract="Variability is a central issue in deep submicron technologies, 
in which it becomes increasingly difficult to produce two chips with the 
same behavior. While the impact of variability is well understood from the 
microelectronic point of view, very few works investigated its 
significance for cryptographic implementations. This is an important 
concern as 65-nanometer and smaller technologies are soon going to equip 
an increasing number of security-enabled devices. Based on measurements 
performed on 20 prototype chips of an AES S-box, this paper provides the 
first comprehensive treatment of variability issues for side-channel 
attacks. We show that technology scaling implies important changes in 
terms of physical security. First, common leakage models (e.g. based on 
the Hamming weight of the manipulated data) are no longer valid as the 
size of transistors shrinks, even for standard CMOS circuits. This impacts 
both the evaluation of hardware countermeasures and formal works assuming 
that independent computations lead to independent leakage. Second, we 
discuss the consequences of variability for profiled side-channel attacks. 
We study the extend to which a leakage model that is carefully profiled 
for one device can lead to successful attacks against another device. We 
also define the perceived information to quantify this context, which 
generalizes the notion of mutual information with possibly degraded 
leakage models. Our results exhibit that existing side-channel attacks are 
not perfectly suited to this new context. They constitute an important 
step in better understanding the challenges raised by future technologies 
for the theory and practice of leakage resilient cryptography.",

abstract="Evaluating side-channel attacks and countermeasures requires 
determining the amount of information leaked by a target device. For this 
purpose, information extraction procedures published so far essentially 
combine a ``leakage model'' with a ``distinguisher''. Fair evaluations 
ideally require exploiting a perfect leakage model (i.e. exactly 
corresponding to the true leakage distribution) with a Bayesian 
distinguisher. But since such perfect models are generally unknown, 
density estimation techniques have to be used to approximate the leakage 
distribution. This raises the fundamental problem that all security 
evaluations are potentially biased by both estimation and assumption 
errors. Hence, the best that we can hope is to be aware of these errors. 
In this paper, we provide and implement methodological tools to solve this 
issue. Namely, we show how sound statistical techniques allow both 
quantifying the leakage of a chip, and certifying that the amount of 
information extracted is close to the maximum value that would be obtained 
with a perfect model.",

abstract="Leakage certification aims at guaranteeing that the statistical 
models used in side-channel security evaluations are close to the true 
statistical distribution of the leakages, hence can be used to approximate 
a worst-case security level. Previous works in this direction were only 
qualitative: for a given amount of measurements available to an evaluation 
laboratory, they rated a model as ``good enough'' if the model assumption 
errors (i.e., the errors due to an incorrect choice of model family) were 
small with respect to the model estimation errors. We revisit this problem 
by providing the first quantitative tools for leakage certification. For 
this purpose, we provide bounds for the (unknown) Mutual Information 
metric that corresponds to the true statistical distribution of the 
leakages based on two easy-to-compute information theoretic quantities: 
the Perceived Information, which is the amount of information that can be 
extracted from a leaking device thanks to an estimated statistical model, 
possibly biased due to estimation and assumption errors, and the 
Hypothetical Information, which is the amount of information that would be 
extracted from an hypothetical device exactly following the model 
distribution. This positive outcome derives from the observation that 
while the estimation of the Mutual Information is in general a hard 
problem (i.e., estimators are biased and their convergence is 
distribution-dependent), it is significantly simplified in the case of 
statistical inference attacks where a target random variable (e.g., a key 
in a cryptographic setting) has a constant (e.g., uniform) probability. 
Our results therefore provide a general and principled path to bound the 
worst-case security level of an implementation. They also significantly 
speed up the evaluation of any profiled side-channel attack, since they 
imply that the estimation of the Perceived Information, which embeds an 
expensive cross-validation step, can be bounded by the computation of a 
cheaper Hypothetical Information, for any estimated statistical model.",

fixslicing implementation strategy was originally introduced as a new 
representation for the hardware-oriented GIFT block cipher to achieve very 
efficient software constant-time implementations. In this article, we show 
that the fundamental idea underlying the fixslicing technique is not of 
interest only for GIFT, but can be applied to other ciphers as well. 
Especially, we study the benefits of fixslicing in the case of AES and 
show that it allows to reduce by 52\% the amount of operations required by 
the linear layer when compared to the current fastest bitsliced 
implementation on 32-bit platforms. Overall, we report that fixsliced 
AES-128 allows to reach 80 and 91 cycles per byte on ARM Cortex-M and E31 
RISC-V processors respectively (assuming pre-computed round keys), 
improving the previous records on those platforms by 21\% and 26\%. In 
order to highlight that our work also directly improves masked 
implementations that rely on bitslicing, we report implementation results 
when integrating first-order masking that outperform by 12\% the fastest 
results reported in the literature on ARM Cortex-M4. Finally, we 
demonstrate the genericity of the fixslicing technique for AES-like

its inverse can be done efficiently with combinational logic. This 
approach has advantages over a straight-forward implementation using 
read-only memories for table lookups. Most of the functionality is used 
for both encryption and decryption. The resulting circuit offers low 
transistor count, has low die-size, is convenient for pipelining, and can 
be realized easily within a semi-custom design methodology like a 
standard-cell design. Our standard cell implementation on a 0.6 $\mu$m 
CMOS process requires an area of only 0.108 mm2 and has delay below 15 ns 
which equals a maximum clock frequency of 70 MHz. These results were 
achieved without applying any speed optimization techniques like
